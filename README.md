# GradeDrivingTrip
## This project is asscociated with my academic research paper (to be published).
It implemented a grading system to give each trip by various drivers a score, so to evaluate their driver behavior.
This grading system is a regression model but it requires no labeled training data for model building, with a large population
of driving history data, this system will able to learn meaningful features to represent how a driver behaves good or bad during
one trip. The features are of good interpretability to convince drivers.

## Data and Source codes will be availabe here in this project after paper published!
